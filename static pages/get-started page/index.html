                <h2>How to play Sudoku</h2>
                <p>The goal of Sudoku is to fill in a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, row, and 3×3 section
                    contain
                    the numbers between 1 to 9. At the beginning of the game, the 9×9 grid will have some of the squares
                    filled in. Your job is to use logic to fill in the missing digits and complete the grid. Don’t
                    forget, a
                    move is incorrect if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any row contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 9</li>
                    <li>Any column contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 9</li>
                    <li>Any 3×3 grid contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 9</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Sudoku Tips</h2>
                <p>Sudoku is a fun puzzle game once you get the hang of it. At the same time, learning to play Sudoku
                    can be
                    a bit intimidating for beginners. So, if you are a complete beginner, here are a few Sudoku tips
                    that
                    you can use to improve your Sudoku skills.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tip 1: Look for rows, columns of 3×3 sections that contain 5 or more numbers. Work through the
                        remaining empty cells, trying the numbers that have not been used. In many cases, you will find
                        numbers that can only be placed in one position considering the other numbers that are already
                        in
                        its row, column, and 3×3 grid.</li>
                    <li>Tip 2: Break the grid up visually into 3 columns and 3 rows. Each large column will have 3, 3×3
                        grids and each row will have 3, 3×3 grids. Now, look for columns or grids that have 2 of the
                        same
                        number. Logically, there must be a 3rd copy of the same number in the only remaining 9-cell
                        section.
                        Look at each of the remaining 9 positions and see if you can find the location of the missing
                        number.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Now that you know a little more about Sudoku, play and enjoy this free online game.</p>
